# Book-Store
<div>
  <p>
    this project is simple sample of a Book Store .<br>
    you can see list of books filtered by <i>top sell</i> ,  <i>top discount</i> , <i>newest</i> and so on<br>
    also you can search in books and find books acording to <i>autor name</i> , <i>book name</i> and  <i>group</i>.<br>
    It's not a real app actually but it's a base project for online shop and a sandbox to learn.
